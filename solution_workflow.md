# Solution Workflow  

1. **Patient Input**:  
   - The patient inputs their medical history and recovery goals into the system via the app.  

2. **AI Plan Generation**:  
   - The AI analyzes patient data to create a personalized recovery plan tailored to their treatment history and health goals.  

3. **Wearable Monitoring**:  
   - Wearable devices like Fitbit track vitals such as heart rate, blood pressure, and physical activity, sending real-time data to the backend.  

4. **Anomaly Detection & Plan Updates**:  
   - The AI continuously monitors the incoming data for anomalies. If an issue is detected, it updates the recovery plan dynamically and alerts caregivers.  

5. **Teleconsultation & Chat Support**:  
   - Patients can schedule virtual consultations with healthcare providers or use the AI chatbot for instant guidance and support.  

6. **Patient Dashboard**:  
   - The dashboard displays real-time insights about progress, goals, and personalized tips for recovery.  

7. **Provider Dashboard**:  
   - Healthcare providers manage patient recovery plans, monitor vitals, and receive automated alerts for critical updates.
